# Sentiment-and-Semantic-Analysis
Finding Polarity of a text and structural relationship between words using Python
- Created a python tool that performs sentimental and semantic analysis on real-time tweets and news articles.
- Performed twitter data extraction(i.e.using tweepy library) and cleaning through python scripts.
- Visualized the most frequently occurring words in the positive and negative tweets in Tableau.
- Computed TF-IDF(i.e.term frequency, inverse document frequency) and highest relative frequency in terms of semantic analysis.
